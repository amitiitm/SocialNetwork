The warranty only covers damages that are not caused by accidents, inappropriate use or wear and tear.

This warranty service is free of charge.\r\rThe damaged product should be given to an authorised ##companyshortname## retailer. Please contact ##companyshortname## directly at their toll-free number ##companycontactno##. If products are sent by post, they should be sent by certified mail and insured, as ##companyshortname## cannot be held liable for damage, loss or theft occurring during transport.

Please keep the delivery receipt as it serves as a warranty for products purchased from the online shop."
